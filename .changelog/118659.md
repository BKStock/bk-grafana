body: 'LoadingState: Add PartialResult state for partially loading queries'
---

Add `LoadingState.PartialResult` to support data sources that load partial results.

This new state behaves functionally the same as `LoadingState.Streaming`, with the key difference that it is expected to receive a `LoadingState.Done` before being considered complete. This prevents issues where streaming data sources are incorrectly marked as "done" too early, particularly in reporting contexts.

**For data source developers:**

- Use `LoadingState.PartialResult` when returning partial query results that will be followed by more data
- Always send `LoadingState.Done` when all results have been loaded
- This is especially useful for query splitting strategies (e.g., `lokiQuerySplitting`)

**Breaking changes:**

- None. This is an additive change marked as `@alpha`

**Note:** The corresponding Go SDK will need to be updated in `grafana-plugin-sdk-go/data/frame_meta.go` to maintain compatibility.
