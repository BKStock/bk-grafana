# Golden files are generated by running the backend conversion tests.
# They are consumed by the frontend parity test (transformSaveModelV1ToV2.test.ts).
# Only the checksums (golden_checksums.json) are tracked in git.
#
# To generate golden files locally:
#   make generate-golden-files    (from apps/dashboard/)
#
# To regenerate checksums after changing conversions:
#   make regenerate-golden-checksums    (from apps/dashboard/)
